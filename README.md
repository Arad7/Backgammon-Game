## How to Play  
1. **Setup**:  
   - Two players take turns rolling dice and moving checkers on a board.
   - Each player moves checkers in opposite directions to their home quarter.  

2. **Player Turn**:  
   - Dice are rolled automatically.  
   - Players can select which dice value they want to use first.  
   - Click on a checker to move it based on the dice value.  
   - A checker can only move to:
     - An empty location.
     - A location where the player already has checkers.  

3. **Movement Rules**:  
   - Moves are valid only if the destination is within the board limits and adheres to the rules.  
   - **Hitting (capturing opponent checkers)** is not allowed in this version.  
   - Doubles (rolling the same value on both dice) are not part of the game.  

4. **Winning the Game**:  
   - The first player to move all their checkers to their home quarter wins.  
   - Unlike traditional Backgammon, there is **no bearing off** after moving checkers to the home quarter.
